Audit Management System: Full-Stack Application
Overview:
The Audit Management System is a scalable web application designed to streamline the audit process, ensuring transparency, compliance, and efficiency in managing audit tasks, reports, and user roles. The system leverages both Angular and React for front-end development, giving flexibility to use either technology stack depending on project needs. It is powered by a robust Spring Boot microservices backend, with data storage using an in-memory H2 Database for rapid testing and prototyping. The entire application is deployed on Amazon Web Services (AWS) to ensure scalability, reliability, and ease of access.

Key Features:
User Management:

Admins can create, read, update, and delete users.
Role-based access control (e.g., auditors, administrators, clients).
Audit Module:

Schedule and manage audit tasks.
Track audit statuses (Pending, In Progress, Completed).
Generate detailed audit reports and export them as PDFs.
Compliance Checks:

Pre-configured compliance checklists to ensure adherence to regulations.
Automated reminders for upcoming audits.
Dashboard & Analytics:

A visual dashboard displaying audit statuses, user activity, and compliance reports.
Key performance indicators (KPIs) displayed with charts and graphs for quick insights.
Microservice Architecture:

Spring Boot Microservices structure for handling different functionalities such as user management, audit processing, reporting, and notifications.
Independent service deployment allows scaling specific parts of the application as needed.
Database Integration:

In-memory H2 Database for development and testing.
Spring Data JPA for easy interaction with the H2 database.
Console for viewing, querying, and managing audit records directly via the H2 console (localhost:8080/h2-console).
AWS Cloud Deployment:

Full-stack deployment on AWS using services like EC2 (for hosting the backend), S3 (for file storage and static assets), and RDS for a production-grade database.
Load balancing and auto-scaling configurations ensure high availability and fault tolerance.
API Gateway and AWS Lambda for handling serverless microservice functions.
Security:

Spring Security integrated for authentication and authorization.
OAuth2 for secure login with third-party services (e.g., Google, GitHub).
HTTPS enforcement for secure communication.
Real-Time Notifications:

Email notifications and alerts for auditors and clients regarding audit progress.
Integration with AWS SNS for SMS notifications.
Tech Stack:
Frontend:

Angular Application:
Angular is used to build a dynamic and interactive user interface for managing audits.
Responsive design with Bootstrap for styling.
Routing, data binding, and state management using RxJS and Services.
Deployed on AWS S3 for serving as a static website.
React Application:
React is used as an alternative front-end for clients preferring a component-based architecture.
Redux for state management, enabling predictable state updates.
Integration with Spring Boot's REST APIs via Axios or Fetch.
Deployed separately on AWS or other services such as Netlify.
Backend:

Spring Boot Microservices:
Each microservice handles a specific domain (User, Audit, Compliance, Notification).
Spring Data JPA for database operations.
RESTful APIs for communication between frontend and backend.
Spring Cloud for microservices coordination, discovery, and load balancing.
Database:

H2 Database for development:
Simple in-memory database for rapid development and testing.
H2 Console for running queries and viewing tables.
AWS RDS for production:
Uses PostgreSQL or MySQL in production for scalable database storage.
Cloud Services:

AWS EC2 for hosting the backend services.
AWS S3 for storing static files, audit reports, and media.
AWS API Gateway to expose REST APIs to the frontends.
AWS Lambda for serverless processing tasks (e.g., notifications).
AWS SNS (Simple Notification Service) for real-time alerts.
Version Control & CI/CD:

GitHub for source code management.
Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines with GitHub Actions or Jenkins for automated builds and deployments on AWS.
Testing:

JUnit and Mockito for backend unit testing.
Karma and Jasmine for Angular unit tests.
Jest for React testing.
Development Workflow:
Developing with Angular:

Run the Angular project locally:
bash
Copy code
ng serve
Build and deploy to S3:
bash
Copy code
ng build --prod
aws s3 sync ./dist/my-angular-app s3://my-audit-system-bucket
Developing with React:

Run the React project locally:
bash
Copy code
npm start
Build and deploy to S3:
bash
Copy code
npm run build
aws s3 sync ./build s3://my-react-audit-system-bucket
Developing with Spring Boot:

Run the microservices locally:
bash
Copy code
mvn spring-boot:run
Deploy Spring Boot services to AWS EC2:
bash
Copy code
scp -i my-keypair.pem target/myapp.jar ec2-user@ec2-xx-xx-xx-xx.compute-1.amazonaws.com:/home/ec2-user/
ssh -i my-keypair.pem ec2-user@ec2-xx-xx-xx-xx.compute-1.amazonaws.com
java -jar myapp.jar
Conclusion:
This Audit Management System provides a comprehensive solution for managing and tracking audits with flexible front-end technologies (Angular and React), a robust backend using Spring Boot Microservices, and seamless deployment on AWS. The use of H2 for local development enables quick testing, while AWS services ensure that the application is production-ready, scalable, and secure.
