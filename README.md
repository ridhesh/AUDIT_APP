Audit Management System Overview
The Audit Management System is a comprehensive solution designed to streamline and automate the audit process for organizations. The system provides a platform to manage audit-related activities, track compliance, and generate detailed reports. By leveraging Angular for the frontend, Spring Boot microservices for the backend, an H2 in-memory database for lightweight persistence during development, and AWS for deployment, the system ensures a modern, scalable, and responsive audit management experience.

Key Features:
User Management and Authentication:

Role-based access control for different users (Admin, Auditor, Audit Manager).
Secure login and authentication using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
Integration with external identity providers (optional).
Audit Scheduling:

Create and schedule new audits with predefined templates.
Assign auditors and audit managers to specific tasks.
Automated notifications for upcoming and overdue audits.
Audit Process and Tracking:

Real-time tracking of the audit process.
Capture observations, findings, and recommendations in a structured manner.
Ability to attach documents, images, and other evidence to audits.
Compliance Management:

Set up compliance checklists and rules based on industry standards.
Monitor compliance metrics and generate compliance reports.
Audit Reporting:

Generate detailed audit reports with findings, risks, and recommendations.
Customizable report templates for different types of audits.
Export reports in multiple formats (PDF, Excel).
Dashboard and Analytics:

Visual dashboard with key audit metrics and status.
Graphs and charts to monitor audit progress, findings, and trends over time.
Integration with External Systems:

API-based integration with ERP, CRM, and other enterprise systems.
AWS S3 for storing large files such as audit evidence securely.
Technology Stack:
Frontend: Angular

The frontend of the Audit Management System is built using Angular, a powerful JavaScript framework for creating dynamic, responsive single-page applications (SPAs).
Key Angular Features:
Component-based architecture for modular development.
Routing for managing different sections like dashboards, reports, and audit management.
Data binding for real-time updates of audit data.
Forms and validation to handle user input and audit creation forms.
Backend: Spring Boot Microservices

The backend leverages Spring Boot microservices to ensure the application is modular, scalable, and loosely coupled.
Key Microservices:
User Service: Handles user authentication, authorization, and management.
Audit Service: Manages the creation, scheduling, and tracking of audits.
Compliance Service: Manages compliance rules, checklist generation, and validation.
Report Service: Generates and manages audit reports.
Communication between microservices is done via REST APIs or message queues.
Spring Security ensures role-based access control.
Database: H2 Console

During development, an H2 in-memory database is used for fast and lightweight storage.
The H2 Console provides a web-based interface for querying the database and checking the state of the application.
For production, it can be easily swapped with a more robust database like MySQL or PostgreSQL.
Cloud Deployment: AWS

The Audit Management System is deployed on AWS for scalability and high availability.
Key AWS Services Used:
AWS EC2: For hosting the microservices and the Angular frontend.
AWS RDS: (If using a persistent database) For managing a production-grade relational database like MySQL/PostgreSQL.
AWS S3: For secure storage of large files such as audit reports, images, and supporting documents.
AWS Lambda: For handling asynchronous processing tasks or small background jobs (optional).
AWS CloudWatch: For monitoring and logging the applicationâ€™s performance.
AWS API Gateway: For exposing microservices in a secure and scalable manner.
System Architecture:
Frontend (Angular SPA):

The Angular frontend communicates with the backend via REST APIs.
Role-based views to ensure only authorized users can access specific parts of the application.
Backend (Spring Boot Microservices):

Service Discovery (using Netflix Eureka) to manage microservices and ensure they communicate seamlessly.
Spring Cloud Gateway as an API gateway for routing requests to the appropriate microservices.
Centralized Configuration using Spring Cloud Config to manage environment variables and configuration settings for all microservices.
Circuit Breaker (via Resilience4j) to ensure the system remains stable even if some microservices fail.
Database (H2 / AWS RDS):

The system uses an H2 in-memory database for local development with the option to switch to AWS RDS for production environments.
Audit data, user data, and compliance information are stored in relational databases.
File Storage (AWS S3):

AWS S3 stores audit evidence, large documents, and generated reports securely, allowing them to be retrieved whenever necessary.
Security Features:
JWT Authentication for secure communication between the frontend and backend.
Role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access to audit-related information.
Data encryption (both at rest and in transit) using AWS KMS and SSL certificates.
Audit trails to track user actions and audit modifications.
Deployment Flow:
Development:
Local development is facilitated using H2 for database operations and Angular CLI for frontend development.
Testing:
Use of JUnit and Mockito for unit testing microservices.
Karma and Jasmine for testing the Angular frontend.
Deployment:
Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline set up using GitHub Actions or Jenkins.
Docker containers for microservices to ensure consistency across environments.
Deployment to AWS EC2 instances using AWS CodeDeploy or Elastic Beanstalk.
Conclusion:
This Audit Management System offers a robust and scalable solution to handle all aspects of auditing and compliance. The combination of Angular for a responsive frontend, Spring Boot microservices for modular backend architecture, and AWS for scalable cloud infrastructure ensures that the system is ready to meet the needs of large and small organizations alike.
